Async Learning Task: Ant Model

In this asynchronous learning task, you must extend the ant model we started in class and implement the following:
1. There are two clusters of food patches randomly positioned in the environment.
2. When an ant finds food, it brings it back to the colony. It ignores other food patches that it will walk over.
3. An ant leaves a pheromone trail on the patches that it passes going back to the colony.
4. Ants will find food again until there is no more food in the environment. 

You will be working as a pair on this task.
